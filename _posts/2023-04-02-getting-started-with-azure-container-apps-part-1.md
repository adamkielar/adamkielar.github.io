**In recent years, containerization has become an increasingly popular way to package and deploy applications. It provides a lightweight and portable environment that can be easily moved between different systems and platforms. Microsoft Azure has embraced this trend and offers a powerful solution called Azure Container Apps, which combines the benefits of containers with the flexibility and scalability of serverless computing. Azure Container Apps architecture is based on a serverless approach that abstracts away the infrastructure layer and enables developers to focus solely on the application code. The architecture is designed to provide a seamless experience for developers, allowing them to create, deploy, and manage containerized applications without the need to worry about the underlying infrastructure.**
